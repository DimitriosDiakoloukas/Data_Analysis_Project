% OUR OBSERVTIONS AND RESULTS BELOW

% We observe that the linear regression model doesn't satisfy the problem as much.
% That is because the data don't have quite a linear correlation. To begin
% with in the linear regression model for the Setup and EDduration without TMS 
% there is no significant relationship between EDduration and Setup in the
% linear regression model as you can also clearly see in our plots also given the
% R-squared of 0.00599 and also given the p-value that is around 0.372 we can
% say that the p value is less than 0.05. In contrast to this case we also 
% found out that the linear regression when the Setup and the EDduration are
% with TMS there is a very low p value more specifically approximately
% 0.00139 and which means that the probability of observing the given data
% under H0 is very small and so we can reject H0 (null hypothesis) and
% conclude that the correlation coefficient œÅ is not zero which means that
% we probably have a weak statistical relationship, given that we still have a
% low R-squared of 0.084. We can see from our plots that the TMS linear regression
% is better No TMS. Finally, we experimented with polynomial regression of degrees
% [2, 3, 5] for each of the models for both TMS and No TMS Setup and
% EDduration. Then we came into the conclusion that the polynomial models
% on EDduration and Setup for both cases provide a stronger relationship
% and also perform better than the linear regression models capturing non-linearities
% better and better as the degree increases.
